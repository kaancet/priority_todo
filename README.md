# Priority ToDo 

This is a simple todo application I built on processing. 

I realized that I was more efficient in planning my day-to-day tasks when I prioritized them based on amount of effort needed and the prority/impact of the task on a 2D grid.

I still need to add functionality to the Clear Button but I just wanted to create the repository for now.

### To-Do
* Add function to Clear Button.
* Add save/load properties
* Create a standalone exe
