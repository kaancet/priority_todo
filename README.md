# Priority ToDo 

This is a simple todo application I built on processing. 

I realized that I was more efficient in planning my day-to-day tasks when I prioritized them based on amount of effort needed and the prority/impact of the task on a 2D grid.

### Update 
* Added save and load functions

### More To-Do
* Add rotated text "effort"
* task item text bounds
* Determine and failsafe invalid user inputs
	* due date<current date
* Add right click property to task items(?)
* Create a standalone exe
